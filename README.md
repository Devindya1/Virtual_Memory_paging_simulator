This project is a Virtual Memory Paging Simulator built using C and JavaScript.
It demonstrates core OS memory-management concepts such as paging, page tables, frame allocation, page faults, and logical-to-physical address translation.
The project includes:

A C console simulator

A simple web-based simulator

Clear output for hits, misses, and physical address results

Great for learning how virtual memory works internally.
